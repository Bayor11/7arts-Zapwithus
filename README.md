This was quickly strungged up to run on Streamlit for you to be able to see the calculations in perspective.

## Recap of the Model

### Formula for Artwork Value

```
Value = BaseValue * (1 + (DGR * ValueFactor))^((Year - 2024) * 365 + DayOfYear)
```

### Value Factor Calculation

```
def calculate_value_factor(maxvalue, bv, bid):
  """Calculates the value factor based on the given parameters.

  Args:
    maxvalue: The maximum value for the artwork.
    bv: The base value of the artwork.
    bid: The bid for the artwork.

  Returns:
    The calculated value factor.
  """

  if bid < bv:
    raise ValueError("Bid cannot be less than base value")

  midvalue = (maxvalue + bv) / 2

  # Linear increase within the maxvalue range
  if bid <= maxvalue:
    value_factor = 1 + (bid - bv) / (maxvalue - bv) * 5
    return max(value_factor, 1)

  # Quadratic increase beyond the maxvalue range
  else:
    excess = bid - maxvalue
    quadratic_factor = 6 + (excess / midvalue) ** 2
    return quadratic_factor
```

### Summary of Terms

* **Value:** The calculated value of the artwork.
* **BaseValue (BV):** The initial purchase price of the artwork.
* **DGR:** The base daily growth rate (e.g., 0.0012 for approximately 50% annual growth).
* **ValueFactor:** A multiplier for the base daily growth rate, determined by the `calculate_value_factor` function.
* **Year:** The current year (e.g., 2024).
* **DayOfYear:** The day of the year (1-366).
* **maxvalue:** The maximum value used for determining the value factor.
* **bv:** The base value of the artwork (same as BaseValue).
* **bid:** The bid price for the artwork.
* **midvalue:** The average of maxvalue and base value.

### How it Works
* The `calculate_value_factor` function determines a multiplier based on the bid price relative to the base value and maximum value.
* The `valueFactor` is applied to the base daily growth rate to adjust the overall growth rate.
* The adjusted growth rate is compounded over time using the number of days since the start of 2024.
* The final value is calculated by multiplying the base value by the compounded growth factor.

This model provides a flexible framework for valuing artwork based on various parameters and incorporates a dynamic growth rate mechanism.
